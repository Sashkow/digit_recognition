----------------------- REVIEWER 1 ---------------------
English sholuld be improved. IMHO, more detailed description should be given to what exactly has been done in the paper. The Results section should be more informative. 

----------------------- REVIEWER 2 ---------------------
ENGLISH: Please, improve your English and revise your text carefully. Take note of such a bad grammar as "..metadata IS...", this word is plural. 
STRUCTURE: 1) For a better understanding of your materials, it would be a good thing if you explain the meaning of any technical or specific terms (for example, "preeclampsia-affected", "pre-eclampsia" in abstract and background sections) before their first mention in the text; the term "GEO" is only explained in the Discussion section, though it has been repeatedly mentioned above; 2) Authors refer to a supplement file 'Supplement 1 — ArrayExpress Experiments’ Accession Numbers, still there is no any supplement part of the contribution. Moreover, if you would like to add some additional information, an example of some code or database, please include it as an appendix section to the text after the REFERENCES section instead of a separate supplement file. 3) Take note for headings and subheadings style that have to meet the requirements prescribed in the Forum template (continuous numbering, uppercase nouns). 
GENERAL: Cumulatively, the paper is very interesting, especially for those who deals with a creation of databases; but it is too specific for general interest. I would recommend to explain some terms and approaches in more simple way and outline first the main ideas and results, and then dwell on particulars of the issues being discussed.

----------------------- REVIEWER 3 ---------------------
Most of sentences should be simplifyed, the text needs grammatical corrections. The article must be rewritten in scientific manner, words and expressions such as "naive approach", "luckily", etc. must be avoided at all times. The normal structure of scientific paper is missing, conclusions are missing completely. The work can be accepted after major revisions, but in a current state cannot be accepted as a paper. 

 ----------------------Publication Chair -----------------
Put a space character after the "Abstact— " and "Keywords— " . 
In the References, the titles of Journals should not be italicized.
---------------------------------------------------------------
DECISION: Would be accepted as a Forum Paper in Biological and Medical Physics Session after corrections are made.
